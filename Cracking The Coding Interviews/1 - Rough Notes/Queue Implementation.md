# Queue Implementation


# Quick Overview
a queue use FIFO principle they are also required implementation for better understanding like stacks so if you will implement them it will be better with these operations

add(item):add an item to tail (end) of the list
remove():remove head (first) node of the list
peek():return the top of the queue
isEmpty():check the list is empty or not

a queue can be implementing with linked list but if you want you can implement with other methods

also they are widely used in BFS algorithm
