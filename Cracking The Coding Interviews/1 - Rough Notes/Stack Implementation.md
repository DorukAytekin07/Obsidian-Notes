 # Stack Implementation

# Quick Overview
the stack data structure is pretty straightforward data structure
it uses LIFO principle also this is a homework for better understand i suggest implementing it with following operations

pop(): Remove item from top of stack
push(item):push an item to top of stack
peek():return an item from top of stack
isEmpty():check the stack it is empty or not if it is empty return True otherwise return False

write benefits of stacks also disadvantages and do not forget implement them
