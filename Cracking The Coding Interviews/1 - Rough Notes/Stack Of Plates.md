# Stack Of Plates
# Question
imagine a stack of plates if stack gets too high it might topple therefore in real life we would start a new stack when previous stack exceeds some threshold implement a data structure SetOfStacks() that mimics this SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity
SetOfStacks.push() and SetofStacks.pop() should behave identically
to a single stack (that is pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack )

FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt(index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack
