### What is a tree 
A tree is a data structure composed of nodes and it also has some rules
- Each tree has a root node
- the root node has zero or more child nodes
- each child node has zero or more child nodes and so on 
### Types of tree
##### Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children 
not all trees are binary trees

##### Binary Search Trees
a binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property all left descendants <= n < all right descendants this must be true for each node n

##### Balanced Vs Unbalanced
while many trees are balanced not all are ask your for clarification here note that balancing tree does not mean the left and right subtrees are exactly the same size
one way to think about it is that a balanced tree really means something more like not terribly imbalanced it's balanced enough to ensure $O(\log n)$ times for insert and find but it's not necessarily as balanced as it could be

##### Complete Binary Trees
a complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level of tree is fully filled except for perhaps 
the last level to the extent that the last level is filled it is filled left to right

##### Full Binary Trees
a full binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children that is no nodes have only child

##### Perfect Binary Trees
a perfect binary tree is one that is both full and complete all leaf nodes will be at the same level and this level has the maximum number of nodes
