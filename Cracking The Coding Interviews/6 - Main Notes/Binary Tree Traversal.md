### Binary Traversal Types

##### In-Order Traversal
in order traversal means to visit the left branch then the current node and finally right branch when performed on a binary search tree it visit the nodes in ascending order
##### Pre-order Traversal
pre order traversal visits the current branch before its child nodes
in a pre order traversal the root is always the first node visited
###### Post-Order Traversal
post order traversal visits the current node after child nodes
in a post order traversal the root is always the last node visited
