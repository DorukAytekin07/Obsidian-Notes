# Runner Technique


# Quick Overview

this technique also known as second-pointer technique you have 2 pointers one of them called fast pointer and other one called slow pointer you search through it
# Detailed Research

this technique have various names second-pointer two-pointer it changes but this is not very important important thing is how it is worked 

as you understand from his name we have two pointers one of them is called fast other one is slow and they are iterate until one of them is reach end or satisfies a condition 

alright where we will use them lets says we have a linked list like that $a_{1} \to a_{2} \to \dots \to a_{n} \to b_{1} \to b_{2} \to \dots \to b_{n}$ and you want to rearrange to $a_{1} \to b_{1} \to a_{2} \to b_{2} \to \dots \to a_{n} \to b_{n}$  in this scenario you will use this runner technique and you will assign p1 to $a_{1}$ and you will assign p2 to $b_{1}$ 

so with this when p2 finished we get the result that we want
