# Three In One
# Question
Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks
# Solution
it said only describe so i will only explain how will i do firstly i din't understand the question but i assume he wants concrete the 3 stacks but if it does it will be too easy because all you have to is initialize 1 stack after push the values of that 3 stacks to this main stack so as i said this is a terrible question
