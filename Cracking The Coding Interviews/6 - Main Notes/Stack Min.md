# Stack Min
# Question
How would you design a stack which in addition to push and pop has a function min which return minimum element in stack push pop and min should all operate in $O(1)$ time 
# Solution
this question can't solved even with the book solution's because it says initialize stack with empty after you add decide minimum but in real world we also want to initialize array when we create them so it can't operate in $O(1)$ time but if you want you can implement a sorting algorithms to our stack implementation
