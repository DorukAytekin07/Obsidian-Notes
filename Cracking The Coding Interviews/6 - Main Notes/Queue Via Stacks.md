# Queue Via Stacks
# Question
Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue with using two stacks 

# Solution
it is a easy question if you understand the base of question and create a logic to solve it our logic is create two stacks named oldStack and newStack and we use oldStack for shifting operation because when you want to peek element and remove element you have to go to head of stack i won't implement this because i don't know but you can implementation in page 247
