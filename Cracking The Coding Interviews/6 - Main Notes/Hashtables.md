# Hash tables

# Quick Overview

hash tables are data structure that maps keys to some values so with this you can make efficient searches and efficient 

level of this searches in best case O(1) and at worst case O(N)

they can implement in many ways you can use balanced binary tress or with linked-list


# Detailed Research

hash tables are very important data structure especially if you want to store some elements with specified keys

all right what is the benefits of hash tables they main benefits is fast searches rather than linked-lists and arrays 

but they disadvantages is they take more space than arrays and linked-list also it is not occur always but sometimes it can be
hash function might create same key for different values

this calling hash collision and all thing like CS this have solution too we use linked-list for collision values and search from the linked-list (alternatively you can also use array but i think linked-list more efficient)
