today is the first the day we switched to obsidian from pen and paper i think this method way more convenient from pen and paper anyways we continue with daily report i don't know the reason but the weekends are more bad than weekdays probably it is because of we have more free time and we don't want to start to study as like newton 2nd law if you are stopping you will continue to stop if you are moving you continue to moving but i thin i will gonna solve this problem as soon as possible so no worry about that btw the zettelkasten method is very useful i love to use it it has very good benefits rather than our previous method whatever lets end this report we don't have anything to write now oh also probably tomorrow our server will have internet connection
