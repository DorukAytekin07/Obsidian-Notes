### What is satisfiability and unsatisfiability
a satisfiable compound statement is if there is an assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true 

when the compound proposition id false for all assignments of truth values to its variables the compound proposition is unsatisfiable

also a  compound statement is unsatisfiable when the negation is true for all assignments of truth values it means if its negation is tautology

### How we can solve them or demonstrate them
there is two way to solve them first is draw truth table second is thinking about question and produce some ways to solve question
first  way sometimes be very exhausted so trying solve it with second way is not a bad option
