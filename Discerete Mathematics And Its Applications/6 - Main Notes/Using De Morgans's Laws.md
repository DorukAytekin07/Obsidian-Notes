# Detailed Research
### Benefit of de morgan's laws
these laws are very important because they tell us how to negate conjunctions and how to negate disjunctions 
and de morgan's laws are 
$\neg(p \vee q) \equiv \neg p \wedge \neg q$ 
$\neg(p \wedge q) \equiv \neg p \vee \neg q$

and don't forget to solve problem about them
