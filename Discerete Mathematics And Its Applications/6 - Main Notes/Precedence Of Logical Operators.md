# Precedence Of Logical Operators

# Hot Notes
it is very important topic like precedence of operators if we make a mistake in these steps we will probably find result wrong

# Detailed Research
like every mathematics operations in here we have operation precedence in the logic we have precedence of logical operators and they are very important because when you trying to find truth value of compound proposition you have to track this way

**Precedence Of Logical Operators**

| Operator          | Precedence |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| $\neg$            | 1          |
| $\wedge$          | 2          |
| $\vee$            | 3          |
| $\rightarrow$     | 4          |
| $\leftrightarrow$ | 5          |

and this is the order i believe you can memorize it quickly
