this topic can be written to paper so i write it while writing we decide it will delete it or keep it

### What Is Propositions
A proposition is a declarative 
sentence ==that can be true or false but not both== 

we use letters to represent propositional variables and the most used letters are p,q,r,s 

furthermore for truth value's propositions we use letters and ==true denoted by T== and truth value of ==false denoted by F== 

and if we cannot express a statement more simpler in terms of propositions it called ==atomic proposition== 

and the area of logic that deals with propositions called ==propositional calculus== or ==propositional logic==

if we want we can create more complex propositions by ==we are formed them with logical operators== and ==they are called compound propositions==

### What Are Logic Operators And Their Types
a ==logical operator== is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expression 

there are plenty of logical operator but i only mentioned 4 of them here (btw totally 7 there are) and they are NOT AND OR XOR logical operators

also you can call them as logical gates or only gates
#### NOT Gate (Negation)
not gate is an inverter if you have T it will invert to F and in mathematics it has plenty denotation but most used ones are $\neg p \sim p$

**Truth Table Of Gate**

| $p$ | $\neg p$ |
| --- | -------- |
| T   | F        |
| F   | T        |

**EXAMPLE**
Find the negation of the proposition
"Michael's "PC runs Linux"
and express this in simple English

**SOLUTION**
This negation can be more simply expressed as
"Michael's PC does not run Linux"

#### AND Gate (Conjunction)

**Truth Table Of And Gate**

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \wedge q$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | T            |
| T   | F   | F            |
| F   | T   | F            |
| F   | F   | F            |

#### OR Gate (Disjunction)

**Truth Table Of Or Gate**

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \vee  q$ |
| --- | --- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T           |
| T   | F   | T           |
| F   | T   | T           |
| F   | F   | F           |

#### XOR Gate

**Truth Table Of XOR Gate**

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \oplus q$ |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| T   | T   | F            |
| T   | F   | T            |
| F   | T   | T            |
| F   | F   | F            |
