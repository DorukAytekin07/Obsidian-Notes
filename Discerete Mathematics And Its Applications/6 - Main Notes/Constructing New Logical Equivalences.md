### How we make logical equivalences
the logical equivalences in previous notes [[6 - Main Notes/Logical Equivalences|Logical Equivalences]] can be used for constructing more complex logical equivalences but be able construct is not essential essential thing is be able to solve them so like always don't forget to solve problem about them
