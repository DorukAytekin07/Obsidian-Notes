# Truth Tables Of Compound Statements


# Hot Notes
we will write this for its example because it is very important we will widely cope with them

# Detailed Research
as we said before we can use logical connectives --conjunction disjunction exclusive or implication biconditional and negation operator-- for produce more complex propositions 

and even how complex of the proposition we can still find truth value of proposition and we can construct truth table 

so lets make an example for better understand

**EXAMPLE**
construct truth table of the compound proposition
$(p \vee \neg q) \rightarrow (p \wedge q)$

**SOLUTION**

| $p$ | $q$ | $\neg p$ | $p\vee\neg q$ | $p\wedge q$ | $(p\vee\neg q) \rightarrow (p \wedge q)$ |
| --- | --- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | F        | T             | T           | T                                        |
| T   | F   | T        | T             | F           | F                                        |
| F   | T   | F        | F             | F           | T                                        |
| F   | F   | T        | T             | F           | F                                        |
