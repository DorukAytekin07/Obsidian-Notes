# Logic And Bit Operations

# Hot Notes
we will use this in  very often in CS so good research them

# Detailed Research
Computers use bits for represent the information 

and a bit can hold only two possible value 1 or 0 

and computer bit operations is like logical connectives the truth tables of $\wedge \vee \oplus$ showed at bottom

**Truth Tables For The Bit Operators OR AND XOR**

| $x$ | $y$ | $x\vee y$ | $x\wedge y$ | $x\oplus y$ |
| --- | --- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| T   | T   | T         | T           | F           |
| T   | F   | T         | F           | T           |
| F   | T   | T         | F           | T           |
| F   | F   | F         | F           | F           |
###### Definition
a bit string is a sequence of zero or more bits the length of this string is the number of bits in the string

**EXAMPLE**
101010011 is a bit string of length nine
