### What is logic circuit
a logic circuit (or digital circuit) receives input signals p1,p2,...,pn each a bit and produces output signals s1,s2,...,sn each a bit

### Type of logic circuits

#### Not Gate
the inverter not gate takes an input bit p and produces as output $\neg p$

#### Or Gate
the or gate takes two input signals and produces as output signal
$p \vee q$

#### And Gate
the and gate takes two input signals and produces as output signal $p\wedge q$
