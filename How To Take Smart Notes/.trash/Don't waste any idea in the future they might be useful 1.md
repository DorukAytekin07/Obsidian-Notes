# Don't waste any idea in the future they might be useful

I mostly agreed with this but sometimes you have to clean your working environment 

probably we will make this clean on our physical notes because now we don't have an index card box but i totally agreed this idea also we have bought index cards from amazon do not waste any idea we produce in school so when we come to home we will write them to our pc

and for the final words when you make a clean to notes select the deleted notes wisely not delete and delete that also delete like that
