# There is no such a thing that can be achieve easily you have to always put an effort


# Quick Overview

actually this is not writing on book but i just thought about this and and i figure out we always want everything getting done easily never wants to put effort on somethings


# Our Ideas

this is one of the main problems of us because we think we can achieve everything easily but the works are not easy like that you have to put a lot of the your works so after a time you will be good at this discipline but we think this time is short but it is not short this time be 1 years or 2 years even be 10 years so being good at one discipline take times
