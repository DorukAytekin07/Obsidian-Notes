# I am starting now this zettelkasten system start with more complexity and reduce it eventually

I think this system start with a huge complexity and eventually reduces but traditional system start with less complexity but eventually increase so at the end you will starting the not understand anything from your notes

book tell this at after pages (actually next page)

yeah yeah it is definitely starts with more complexity or we think this is as a complexity you just don't know the what folder belong to this so 

you guess it has a complexity but this is not complexity this is just flexibility and freedom in the future (i mean as your notes gets larger) you can tag them more accurately 

but in traditional way you in the future you have to make a choose which folder you have to put this note but 

what if it can be in 2 folder (this is the why we named him digital note-taking system and zettelkasten to analog note-taking system)
