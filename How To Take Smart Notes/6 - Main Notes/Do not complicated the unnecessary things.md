# Do not complicated the unnecessary things

actually the book is correct because if you have a easier way to do something do with this way not try to figure out a harder or complicated way if it is work then touch it i think also just focus on essentials might lead to you to success

also we have make this mistake sometimes but while solving math it is work this maybe because of our education system's math problems is very badly designed questions for some of them so do not think about it mostly complicating stuff's is lead to you a headache 

the best example of this our previous not taking system can you achieve anything from your previous note-taking system no so it is waste time now we already arrive a result
