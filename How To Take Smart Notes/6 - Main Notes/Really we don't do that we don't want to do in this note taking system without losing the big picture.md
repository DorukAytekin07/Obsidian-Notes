# Really we don't do that we don't want to do in this note taking system without losing the big picture

Maybe the biggest benefit of this zettelkasten system we can study with easily to harder topics even if we too much struggle with a topic we can create a rough note and write what we understand now then we can research this more goodly time so we can learn this harder topic more easily (it is like dynamically)

but in last method for pass to another topic you have to finish that section if you could not finish or you finished but you didn't understand anything probably you cannot turn back to that section so you won't learn anything from this topic

as i said maybe this is biggest benefit of this method
